# Little Pioneers (Pre-K-2nd)

### Little Pioneers Overview
The Little Pioneers is an in-house program for our Pre-K through 2nd graders. The focus for this age group is to introduce players to soccer and simply have fun. This is the first level of recreational club soccer. As an in-house program, we are able to hold all games within Oregon City.

Little Pioneers runs parallel to our recreational program each season. We encourage players to register **EARLY!**

**Player Registration**
All players must be registered in accordance with the rules of the club, outlined in the Registration Policy (found in Quick Links). To register your player, click [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

**Coaches**
Oregon City Soccer Club will field as many teams as possible, as long as there are enough parent volunteers to coach them. Interested in coaching? Register [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

### Teams/Practice
**Team Assignments**
OCSC has registrants from all over the city which allows players to meet new friends and stay in the community which they attend school.

Teams will be formed based on grade when possible. In order to form teams some players may be put on a mixed grade team (no more than one grade - players may not play down). Players are reassigned to the same roster unless we are asked not to do so. However, because a player was on a certain team last year doesn’t guarantee that same placement if the registration is late. New Club members are assigned to teams based on space, the school attended and if possible, teammate requests.

During the registration process we do allow for parents to “request” players or coaches. Parent coaches always have their child on their team. We want to stress that although you may have requested a teammate or coach, we will NOT guarantee to accommodate your request.

Recreation coaches are all volunteers that dedicate significant amounts of time to the team, and we are grateful for all of our coaches. We are happy that each year we welcome many of our coaches back. Our program works because of our volunteers.

**Practices**
After the coaches' meetings, the coach will reach out to parents to provide information for practice date and time. Practices will be held once per week for Spring and Fall. While not required, it is recommended that players bring their own ball to practice (Size 3).
