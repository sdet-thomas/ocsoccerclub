# Oregon City Soccer Club Programs

## Little Pioneers (Pre-K-2nd)

### Little Pioneers Overview
The Little Pioneers is an in-house program for our Pre-K through 2nd graders. The focus for this age group is to introduce players to soccer and simply have fun. This is the first level of recreational club soccer. As an in-house program, we are able to hold all games within Oregon City.

Little Pioneers runs parallel to our recreational program each season. We encourage players to register **EARLY!**

**Player Registration**
All players must be registered in accordance with the rules of the club, outlined in the Registration Policy (found in Quick Links). To register your player, click [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

**Coaches**
Oregon City Soccer Club will field as many teams as possible, as long as there are enough parent volunteers to coach them. Interested in coaching? Register [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

### Teams/Practice
**Team Assignments**
OCSC has registrants from all over the city which allows players to meet new friends and stay in the community which they attend school.

Teams will be formed based on grade when possible. In order to form teams some players may be put on a mixed grade team (no more than one grade - players may not play down). Players are reassigned to the same roster unless we are asked not to do so. However, because a player was on a certain team last year doesn’t guarantee that same placement if the registration is late. New Club members are assigned to teams based on space, the school attended and if possible, teammate requests.

During the registration process we do allow for parents to “request” players or coaches. Parent coaches always have their child on their team. We want to stress that although you may have requested a teammate or coach, we will NOT guarantee to accommodate your request.

Recreation coaches are all volunteers that dedicate significant amounts of time to the team, and we are grateful for all of our coaches. We are happy that each year we welcome many of our coaches back. Our program works because of our volunteers.

**Practices**
After the coaches' meetings, the coach will reach out to parents to provide information for practice date and time. Practices will be held once per week for Spring and Fall. While not required, it is recommended that players bring their own ball to practice (Size 3).

## High School Coed Program

### High School Coed Program Overview
OCSC offers a High School Coed program for high school freshman through senior players. Teams play games at neighboring clubs such as Willamette United, Clackamas United, Canby United, Estacada, Gladstone, Milwaukie, Molalla and other Oregon City teams.

Players chosen for high school teams may not participate on the recreational coed teams at OCSC per Soccer 5 Rules.

**Player Registration**
All players must be registered in accordance with the rules of the club, outlined in the Registration Policy (found in Quick Links). To register your player click [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

**Coaches**
Oregon City Soccer Club will field as many teams as possible, as long as there are enough parent volunteers to coach them. High school students are not able to coach their own teams therefore an adult volunteer coach is still needed for each team. Interested in coaching? Register [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

### TEAMS/PRACTICE
**Teams**
OCSC will create as many freshman/sophomore and junior/senior teams as we have players and coaches. Because rules require a certain male/female ratio on the field the number of registered players will determine if we can split the teams into those categories. If we are unable to split the teams into the categories listed then we will merge all the high school teams together to form a team.

For players who are trying out for their respective high school teams, you may still register if you are unsure which program, you will be joining. If you register for our program and are then chosen for a high school team, we will provide a full refund minus the $3.00 website service fee.

Recreation coaches are all volunteers that dedicate significant amounts of time to the team, and we are grateful for all of our coaches. We are happy that each year we welcome many of our coaches back. Our program works because of our volunteers.

**Practices**
Once your player is assigned to their team, the coach will reach out to parents to provide information for practice date and time. Practices are determined by the coach. While not required, it is recommended that each player bring their own ball for practice.
