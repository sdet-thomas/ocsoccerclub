# Recreational Youth Soccer (3rd thru 8th)

### Recreational Program Overview
The Recreation program is for grades 3rd through 8th. It is primarily devoted to the enjoyment and development of soccer players without the emphasis on travel or high-level competition.

**Player Registration**
All players must be registered in accordance with the rules of the club, outlined in the Registration Policy (found in Quick Links). To register your player click [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

**Coaches**
Oregon City Soccer Club will field as many teams as possible, as long as there are enough parent volunteers to coach them. Interested in coaching? Register [here](/Default.aspx?tabid=2105853).

### Teams/Practice
OCSC has registrants from all over the city which allows players to meet new friends and stay in the community which they attend school.

Teams will be formed based on grade when possible. In order to form teams some players may be put on a mixed grade team (no more than one grade - players may not play down). Players are reassigned to the same roster unless we are asked not to do so. However, because a player was on a certain team last year doesn’t guarantee that same placement if the registration is late. New Club members are assigned to teams based on space, the school attended and if possible, teammate requests.

During the registration process we do allow for parents to “request” players or coaches. Parent coaches always have their child on their team. We want to stress that although you may have requested a teammate or coach, we will NOT guarantee to accommodate your request.

Recreation coaches are all volunteers that dedicate significant amounts of time to the team, and we are grateful for all of our coaches. We are happy that each year we welcome many of our coaches back. Our program works because of our volunteers.

**Practices**
After the coaches' meetings, the coach will reach out to parents to provide information for practice date and time. Practices will be held two times per week at this age level. While not required, it is helpful if your player brings their own ball to practice. Ages 8-12 use a size 4 ball; Ages 13+ use a size 5 ball.

### Age Group Format
Recreational teams are formed by birth year in accordance with US Youth Soccer rules, therefore you must register your player by their birth year. While we do our best to keep teams together year over year, we may have to move players up by an age group in order to accomplish this.
- 3rd & 4th Grade: Play 7 v 7 games.
- 5th & 6th Grade: Play 9 v 9 games.
- 7th & 8th Grade: Play 11 v 11 games.

**Playing Up**
A player may "play up" in the next age division _if space is available on a team_. No player may "play up" two age divisions. **No exceptions.**

**Playing Down**
A player may not play down an age group. They must at least play in the age division where their birth date falls, regardless of where they were last assigned.
